# Dependency Injection with Factory Method
- In order to inject dependencies using the factory method, we will use two of the attributes 
  1. factory-method -> methods that are invoked to in order to inject the beans
  2. factory-bean -> references of the beans by which factory methods are invoked

## 3 Types of Factory methods
1. Static Factory Method – It is used to return the instance of its own class
2. Static Factory Method – It is used to return the runtime instance of another class.
3. Non-Static Factory Method – It is used to return the runtime instance of another class.
